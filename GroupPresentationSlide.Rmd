## **Facebook Algorithm Matters!**

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="80%"}
download.file(url = "https://media.sproutsocial.com/uploads/2019/05/Social-Index-Data.png",
          destfile = "image.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image.png")
```


## **Facebook’s New Algorithm Prefers Quality Over Quantity**
Facebook has been **changing its algorithm** to improve its transparency on how it ranks content on News Feed

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="80%"}
download.file(url = "https://www.convinceandconvert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Facebook_Chart.jpg",
          destfile = "image2.jpg",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image2.jpg")

```

## **WAIT! There’s More About Facebook's Algorithm**

Facebook breaks the News Feed algorithm into four components:

- Inventory
- Signals
- Predictions
- Overall Score

## **What Happens to the News Feed?**

- **Meaningful Interactions**

![](E:\Year1 Sem2\Data Science for Business\image3.png){width=70%}


## **What Are Menaingful Interactions for Facebook?**

- Multiple people replying to each other’s comments on a video they watched or an article they read in News Feed
- A page responding to a person’s comment on their post
- People commenting on or interacting with a page’s live video
- People responding to page posts shared through Messenger
- Any interactions that people have with a page post that has been re-shared by a user


## **Video Rankings**

- Why are videos important?
- How Facebook did to rank the videos?
- What's the key factors affect videos' ranking?

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="40%"}
download.file(url = "https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180315/xyq/kisspng-video-clip-computer-icons-video-on-demand-clip-art-atm-images-5aaac3e5406379.9370004215211407092637.jpg",
          destfile = "image4.jpg",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image4.jpg")

```

## **Personalized Experiences**

A survey conducted by Facebook in 2019 asked people:

- Who are your close friends?
- What posts do you find valuable?
- How important is content from this Facebook Group to you?
- How interested are you in Pages you follow?

Based on the responses, Facebook is able to adjust its algorithm to make the news feed even better.

Eg: showing people the pages they following the **longest** and **interacting the most**.

## **Spammy, Clickbait & Engagement Bait**

The **key signals** Facebook uses to determine “clickbait-ness” are **headlines exaggerating** or **withholding information**.
By demoting these posts, Facebook is able to reduce the contents which are misleading, biased or outright false. 

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="60%"}
download.file(url = "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/089D/production/_111750220_gettyimages-1215064495.jpg",
          destfile = "image5.jpg",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image5.jpg")

```

## **Example of Clickbait**

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="60%"}
download.file(url = "https://www.clickz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/13672010_1728862364001132_838959904_n.jpg",
          destfile = "image6.jpg",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image6.jpg")

```

## **Example of Engagement Bait**

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="60%"}
download.file(url = "https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/taco-baiting.jpg",
          destfile = "image7.jpg",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image7.jpg")

```

## **Let’s Have a Try!**

- Open your Facebook News Feed and choose a random post/ ad.
- Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of a particular post/ad in your News Feed
- What do you see there?
- Try to customize what you see in the News Feed and customize your settings


```{r results = 'asis', out.width="45%"}
download.file(url = "https://www.demoshelsinki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tryout_logo.png",
          destfile = "image8.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image8.png")

```



## **Facebook Will Then Show the Following Information:**

- Why a certain post is being displayed in the news feed?
- Which factors have the greatest impact on the ranking of posts, including: 
  - How often you interact with posts from people, Pages or Groups
  - How often you interact with a specific type of post, for example, videos, photos or links
  - The popularity of the posts shared by the people, Pages, and Groups you follow.
- Shortcuts to controls, such as See First, Unfollow, News Feed Preferences and Privacy Shortcuts.

## **Example**

```{r results = 'asis', out.width="100%"}
download.file(url = "https://cdn.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/why-am-i-seeing-this-1520x800.png",
          destfile = "image9.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image9.png")

```

## **Tips to Work Better With Mrs. Algorithm**

**Familiarize yourself with how the new algorithm works**

he more signals you can provide to mrs. Algorithm, the hugher chance you can convince her (Mrs. Algorithm) to put your posts on people's news feed.

**Key Signals are:**

- When someone posted a piece of content?
- What type of content the post is?
- How much engagement (e.g., likes, comments, shares) the post has gotten?
- Who’s been engaging with the post?

## **How Exactly Do You Influence Those Signals?**

          destfile = "image10.jpg",

```

## **Make Sure Your Content Is High in Quality and Offers Real Value**
