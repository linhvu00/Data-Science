## **WAIT! There’s more about Facebook's algorithm**

Facebook breaks the News Feed algorithm into four components:

- Inventory

- Overall Score

## **What happens to the News Feed?**

- **Meaningful Interactions**

## **List of Meaningful Interactions**

- Multiple people replying to each other’s comments on a video they watched or an article they read in News Feed

- A page responding to a person’s comment on their post

- People commenting on or interacting with a page’s live video

- People responding to page posts shared through Messenger

- Any interactions that people have with a page post that has been re-shared by a user


## **Video Rankings**

## **Personalized Experiences**

A survey conducted by Facebook in 2019 asked people:

- Who are your close friends?

- What posts do you find valuable?

- How important is content from this Facebook Group to you?

- How interested are you in pages you follow?

Based on the responses, Facebook is able to adjust its algorithm to make the News Feed even better.

Eg: showing people the pages they following the **longest** and **interacting the most**.

## **Spammy, Clickbait & Engagement Bait**

The **key signals** Facebook uses to determine “clickbait-ness” are **headlines exaggerating** or **withholding information**.
By demoting these posts, Facebook is able to reduce the contents which are misleading, biased or outright false.

## **Facebook will then show the following information:**


- Why a certain post is being displayed in the news feed?

- Which factors have the greatest impact on the ranking of posts, including: 

  - How often you interact with posts from people, Pages or Groups

  - How often you interact with a specific type of post, for example, videos, photos or links

  - The popularity of the posts shared by the people, Pages, and Groups you follow.

- Shortcuts to controls, such as See First, Unfollow, News Feed Preferences and Privacy Shortcuts.

- What type of content the post is?

- How much engagement (e.g., likes, comments, shares) the post has gotten?

- Who’s been engaging with the post?

## **Start making videos and doing live video streams**

- Internet users have uploaded more video content online in just the past month than network television generated in 30 years

- Online video now accounts for two-thirds of all online traffic, which could climb up to 82% within the next two years

- As predicted, live video will account for 13% of all online video by 2021, which could be over 80% of global web traffic and 85% of web traffic in the US.

- A single minute of video content is worth 1.8 million words


## **And marketers have already figured it out!**

- 81% of businesses are already using video as part of their marketing and traffic growth strategies
- That’s a pretty substantial increase, as just 63% of businesses were using video in 2017
- Of those businesses that aren’t yet making video content, 65% of them have plans to start by the end of the year


##  **Videos are prioritized over non-video content**

An average, when a page post a video, 16.7% of their fans will see it, which is significantly higher than links, photos, and text contents

Some tips while making video content for Facebook:

- Add captions to your videos

- Upload HD videos (eg: **1080p/720p**)

Examples:

- Post contents relevant to your customers

- Use concise, accurate description or keyword & buzzwords which people can understand easily


## **Actively engage with your audience**
